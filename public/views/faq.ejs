        <div class = "faq-answer" data-id = "1">Hackterms is a community-sourced dictionary of coding terms. Use it to quickly understand:
            <ul>
                <li>Why someone would use this tool/process/language</li>
                <li>What the pros, cons, and alternatives are</li>
                <li>Where the term fits in within the coding ecosystem</li>
                <li>How things connect</li>
            </ul>

            Hackterms is not a holistic resource to learn to code. Think of it as a roadmap to the modern development landscape.

        <div class = "faq-answer" data-id = "2">Absolutely! The goal of Hackterms is to help  gets better with every new perspective added. Your definition might help a fellow developer understand the term better!

        <br><br> 

        All new submissions are reviewed within 24 hours. The goal of the review process is to make sure your submission is a good fit for Hackterms - that is is a coding term that aims to be constructive, objective, and not offensive. We do <span class = "bold">not</span> review submission for technical accuracy, but do review them for topical accuracy. For example, we will approve a definition that says React.js is a language (though this is technically incorrect), but not that it's a type of hamburger.</div>

        </span>
        <div class = "faq-answer" data-id = "3">Any term related to computer programming is great: tools, languages, processes, libraries, frameworks, data structures, algorithms, architecture, project management jargon, you name it!

            <br>
        Naturally, programmers will have diverse opinions about the tools they use. We welcome these, as long as they are presented in an constructive way. Hackterms is not a good fit for non-coding terms (ex: "ramen: the lifeblood of budding developers"), or highly-objective terms

            Yes. Hackterms aims for simplicity, clarity, and high-level understanding.

            Sometimes this means sacrificing accuracy for the sake of readability. Fortunately, lots of other great resources on the web will teach you the ins-and-outs of any topics.

            For me, the hardest thing about learning to code was connected the dots. I struggled with questions like: where is the line between the language and the framework? Why are there so many tools, and do I need to learn them all right now? What do these things do?

            This resonated with my fellow devs, so I decided to create a quick reference to answer these questions.
